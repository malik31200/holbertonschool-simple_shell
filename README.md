## Dev_of_doom_tools ⚒️👾

A template project for building and testing C programs following Holberton-style rules.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 Compile Holberton main files located in the `holberton/` directory (e.g., `0-main.c`, `1-main.c`).
- 🧪 Compile and run unit tests located in the `tests/` directory, supporting any `test_*.c` files.
- 🎯 Capture stdout and stderr output during tests for precise verification.
- 🔧 Flexible Makefile to build binaries and run tests with ease.
- 📁 Automatic creation of build (`build/`) and object (`obj/`) directories.

## ⚙️ How to Use

### Build all 🔨

```bash
make
```

Compiles all Holberton mains and tests, producing executables in the build/ folder.

### Run tests ✅❌
```bash
make test
```

Runs all unit tests, showing pass/fail status.

### Run a specific test 🎯
```bash
make run-test_testname
```

Example:
```bash
make run-test_test_capture
```

### Clean build files 🧹
```bash
make clean
```

Removes all generated object files and binaries.

## 📦 Template Files Included

- `tests/template.c` — A basic empty test file to help you get started quickly 🧪✨
- `holberton/999-main.c` — A placeholder main file for Holberton-style compilation practice 🕹️
- `main.c` — A simple program that prints "Hello, World" for sanity checking your build setup 👋🌍

These templates make it easy to test your setup and add new features or tests without starting from scratch.

## 📝 Notes
🔍 The Makefile auto-detects Holberton main files in holberton/ and test files in tests/.

📂 Object files go to obj/, and executables go to build/.

🛡️ Uses gcc with strict flags (-Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89) for clean, portable C code.

🧪 Uses Unity testing framework with helpers to capture output.

✨ Feel free to customize the Makefile to fit your project’s needs!

## 📋 Project Management

To keep track of tasks, bugs, and features efficiently, we use a Trello template board designed specifically for coding projects like this one.

Check out the [Trello Template Board](https://trello.com/b/GjTcHyyT/template) to get started with the same workflow, labels, and card templates! Feel free to copy it and customize it for your own projects. 🚀✨

For detailed instructions on how to set up and use Trello for your projects, see the [Trello Setup Guide](https://github.com/AdelMej/Dev_of_doom_tools/blob/main/TRELLO_GUIDE.md).


Happy coding! 💻🔥 Tools for the fallen you'll find all you need to fight against c shenanigans
